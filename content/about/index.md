## About me
I’m Sajay Prakash, I’m currently pursuing my Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science and Engineering at Rajalakshmi Engineering College. I love learning more about technology and computers. I'm a GNU/Linux enthusiast and I like to approach everything with a minimalistic and a 'Keep it Simple' ideology.
