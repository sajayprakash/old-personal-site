Most of the software I use is free and open-source. All of them are privacy friendly (except windows). I like to follow a minimalistic lifestyle, so my choices of software will follow a "do one thing, but do it good" attitude. For more software recommendations check out [My megathread](https://sajayprakash.com/megathread).

# Basic Software

## Operating System

- [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) - A lightweight and flexible Linux distribution that tries to keep it simple. 

- [Windows 10 LTSC](https://isofiles.bd581e55.workers.dev/Windows%2010/Windows%2010%20Enterprise%20LTSC%202021/) - Unfortunately I'm still forced to use Windows for gaming so I have to use this proprietary garbage which is slightly better than standard windows 10 and windows 11 (pls don't use windows 11 lol).

## Terminal

- [st](https://github.com/sajayprakash/st) - Simple Terminal by [suckless.org](https://suckless.org/)

## Shell

- [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) - A shell that is better than bash.

## Web browser

- [Librewolf](https://librewolf.net/) - A fork of Firefox, focused on privacy, security and freedom.

- [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) - Probably the best browser. (I use it along with [arkenfox's user.js](https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js)).

- [Brave](https://brave.com/) - Chromium fork with better privacy settings. Don't really recommend it but I use it when sites break/don't load in Firefox.
