Introduction # More often than not, I get asked the question - \u0026ldquo;Why do you use Linux, what is it and why don\u0026rsquo;t you use Windows/MacOS as your primary operating system?\u0026rdquo;. In this blog post, I shall explain to you in detail about what Linux is and why I use it\nWhat is Linux? # Operating System Levels Just like Windows, MacOS, iOS, Android, etc. Linux is just another operating system. Fun fact, the Android operating system is based on Linux.\nTo be more specific, Linux is a kernel and not the operating system itself. A kernel is the core of the operating system that controls the CPU, memory and other devices. What we refer to as the Linux operating system is actually GNU/Linux and not just Linux. Linux is not an operating system by itself but is another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made possible by GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.\nIf all of this went over your head, in simple terms the Linux operating system is actually known as GNU/Linux which uses Linux as its base (Kernel) along with GNU utilities. Most of the webservers around the world use Linux.\nWhy not windows? # First and foremost, Windows is closed-sourced. No one but Microsoft knows what really lies underneath the depths of the Windows source code. In more recent years, Microsoft has really started to push their boundaries with collecting user data, spying, telemetry, advertisements, limited customizabilty, etc. All of these factors make it such that the user is being operated by the operating system and not the other way around.\nWith this constant cycle of trash Windows releases, increased telemetry, advertisements , etc. It was only a matter of time before I had to find an alternative to switch to.\nWhy I use Linux # Linux is open-source, I have full control over everything that happens in my system. I was sold by the idea of Open-Source, no telemetry, full control. When using Linux, I feel like Im using the system how it\u0026rsquo;s supposed to be used - with the user in control of the operating system. I can honestly go on and on about why I use Linux but these are the main reasons.\nThere are hundreds upon hundreds of GNU/Linux operating systems and they are known as distributions or \u0026lsquo;distro\u0026rsquo; for short.I\u0026rsquo;ve probably tried out around 20-30 of them (back when I had free time during COVID-19 lockdown). The distro that I currently use is Arch Linux. It is a minimalist distro and is probably not advisable for beginners as it can be confusing and tedious for Linux noobs.\nShould you use Linux? # It depends. Do you like the idea of having freedom from evil companies like Microsoft, Apple, Google\u0026hellip;? Are you prepared to learn a lot of new things, having hardships figuring out how to use something entierly different? If you answered yes to these questions, then boot up any Linux distro on a virtual machine, spare computer or try it out on a live USB!\nThe software compatibality on Linux can be tricky, software like Adobe products like Photoshop, Premier Pro,etc do not work on Linux. They have their alternatives like GIMP and Kdenlive but can\u0026rsquo;t really compete with their mainstream competition on a professional level. Gaming is also another huge problem on Linux as most games with Anti-Cheat (eg: Valorant, Fortnite) don\u0026rsquo;t work underneath linux. So if these sound like a problem to you then Linux is probably not for you yet.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re trying out Linux and don\u0026rsquo;t know where to begin. I recommend these distros:\nFedora Linux Mint PopOS ","date":"18 September 2022","permalink":"/posts/whyiuselinux/","section":"Posts","summary":"This article may be factually incorrect, feel free to correct me by opening a pull request or submitting an issue on my github repo.

For more software recommendations check out My megathread.\nBasic Software # Operating System # Arch Linux - A lightweight and flexible Linux distribution that tries to keep it simple.\nWindows 10 LTSC - Unfortunately I\u0026rsquo;m still forced to use Windows for gaming so I have to use this proprietary garbage which is slightly better than standard windows 10 and windows 11 (pls don\u0026rsquo;t use windows 11 lol).\nTerminal # st - Simple Terminal by suckless.org Shell # Zsh - A shell that is better than bash. Web browser # Librewolf - A fork of Firefox, focused on privacy, security and freedom.\nFirefox - Probably the best browser. (I use it along with arkenfox\u0026rsquo;s user.js).\nBrave - Chromium fork with better privacy settings. Don\u0026rsquo;t really recommend it but I use it when sites break/don\u0026rsquo;t load in Firefox.\nUtilities # File manager # lf - A Terminal file manager. Media player # MPV - The best media player. Torrent client # qBittorrent - Probably the best torrent client.\nTransmission - More minimalistic torrent client.\nPDF viewer # Zathura - Minimal PDF viewer.\nSumatra - PDF viewer for Windows.\nImage Viewer # sxiv - Simple X Image Viewer\nImageGlass - Image viewer for Windows.\nOffice Suite # Libreoffice - The best open-source office suite. RSS Reader # Newsboat - A terminal RSS feed reader. ","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/programs/","section":"Sajay Prakash","summary":"Most of the software I use is free and open-source.
